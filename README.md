# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect Grouping and Sorting

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: unexpected results due to incorrect grouping or sorting of documents containing null or missing values.

The `bug.js` file contains an example aggregation pipeline that produces incorrect results. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue.

## Bug Description

The original pipeline groups documents by a specific field and then sorts the groups by the count of documents in each group. However, if the field being grouped by contains null or missing values, these values are treated as distinct groups, leading to inaccurate results.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `$ifNull` operator or similar techniques to handle missing or null values before grouping. This ensures that null values are treated consistently and do not distort the results.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running.
3. Run the scripts using the MongoDB shell or a suitable driver.
